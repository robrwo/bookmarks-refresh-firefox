# Refresh Your Bookmarks

This is a firefox extension to refresh your bookmarks when pages have
moved or become stale.

This add-on does the following when you visit a bookmarked page:

- If the server returns an HTTP 400-499 error, it will suggest
  removing the page.

- If the server returns a redirection, will suggest updating your
  bookmark.

- If the page has a canonical link that is different from your
  bookmark, it will suggest updating the bookmark.

The bookmark can be installed from
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/refresh-your-bookmarks/
